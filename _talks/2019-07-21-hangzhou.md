Cybersecurity become more and more important for both states and society. However, traditional approaches based on rules and patterns cannot meet the demanding security requirements. In this talk, we will introduce our recent works on intelligent system security on malware and vulnerabilities. In particular, we will present how Android malware of large scale is accurately and effectively detected, how software vulnerabilities are mined improved by learning knowledge from artifacts, and intelligence driven software testing. Additionally, we will brief the advances of the security of artificial intelligent systems.
