Dr. Guozhu Meng obtained his Ph.D degree from the School of Computer Science and Engineering, Nanyang Technological University, Singapore at 2017. His supervisors are Assoc Prof. [Liu Yang](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/yangliu/) and Assoc Prof. [Zhang Jie](http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/zhangj/). In addition, he has been working closely with Dr. [Xue Yinxing](https://sites.google.com/site/yinxingxue/).

He will join Institute of Information Engineering of Chinese Academy of Sciences as Associate Professor in 2018, working with Prof. [Kai Chen](http://www.kaichen.org). He is currently working as a research fellow in NTU. His research focuses on system security with a specialization on mobile computing as follows:

**Android security**. Conducted a work to analyze Android malware and detect malware (ISSTA 2016 paper, IJCNN 2016 paper), and a work to evaluate existing anti-malware tools (AsiaCCS 2016 paper). Another work has been done, with regard to Android ecosystem, to analyze the spread model of Android malware across multiple markets, and security patches of apps across verions.

**Big data analysis**. We have collected millions of Android apps and malware, and conducted a work to try to learn knowledge from the big data such as malware characteristics, evolution and trend. The main techniques include machine learning, deep learning and statistics inference.

**Mobile energy analysis and optimization**. We have conducted a work to study the issues of power consumption, and propose optimizing solutions to raise the efficiency of battery on mobile device (TMC 2016 paper, ICCPS 2017 paper). In addition, we carry on a work to detect energy bugs in Android apps in order to optimize energy usage at application level.

**Vulnerability detection**. We attempt to detect vulnerabilities existing in Android OS and Android apps. We have instrumented Android OS and Android apps to mark the execution path and trace, and employed testing technology to explore all possible execution paths. We have started to work on the detection of logic vulnerability in Android OS, and security flaws in some security-critical apps such as financial apps.
